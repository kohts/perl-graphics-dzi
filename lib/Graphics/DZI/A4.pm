=head1 NAME

Graphics::DZI::A4 - DeepZoom Image Pyramid Generation, specifically for documents

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Graphics::DZI::A4;
    $Graphics::DZI::log    ->level ($loglevel);
    $Graphics::DZI::A4::log->level ($loglevel);
    my $dzi = new Graphics::DZI::A4 (A4s      => \@images,
				     overlap  => $overlap,
				     tilesize => $tilesize,
                                     path     => './',
                                     prefix   => 'xxx',
				     'format' => 'png',
                             );
    use File::Slurp;
    write_file ('xxx.xml', $dzi->descriptor );
    $dzi->iterate ();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This subclass of L<Graphics::DZI::Files> is specifically though for images covering document
pages. While it is named C<A4>, this is mostly historical; as long as all your images have the same
dimensions, this package should.

The idea is that the whole document (the set of images) forms a large image, the individual images
organized in a square fashion (1x1, 2x2, 4x4, ...). At the highest zoom level of course all pages
will be visible. But if you zoom out, then not only the pages get smaller. Also the pages shown will
be reduced, so that at the smallest zoom level only the first page is visible.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Constructor

Other than the superclass L<Graphics::DZI::Files> this class takes an array (reference) to a list of
images.

=over

=item C<A4s> (no default, list reference)

Do not be fooled by the A4; any format should do.

=head2 Methods

=item B<iterate>

This iterate honors the fact that we are dealing with a set of documents, not ONE large image.

=item B<descriptor>

Also the descriptor generation is a bit special.

    my $format   = $self->format;

    return qq{<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
