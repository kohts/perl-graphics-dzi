Graphics::DZI::Overlay - DeepZoom Image Pyramid, Sparse Images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # build some overlays first
  use Graphics::DZI::Overlay;
  my $o1 = new Graphics::DZI::Overlay (image => ...,       # what is the image?
                                       x => 1000, y=>1000, # where on the canvas?
                                       squeeze => 64);     # how much smaller than the canvas?
  my $o2 = new Graphics::DZI::Overlay (image => ...,       # what is the image?
                                       x => 2000, y=>2000, # where on the canvas?
                                       squeeze => 32);     # how much smaller than the canvas?
  # then add the overlay over the canvas

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package can hold one overlay image, together with a coordinate and a factor how much this
images is smaller than the canvas onto which the image is to be put.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Constructor

It expects the following fields:

=over

=item C<image>: (required)

L<Image::Magick> object.

=item C<x>,C<y>: (integers, no default)

Coordinates of the top-left corner of the above image on the canvas 

=item C<squeeze>: (integers, no default)

A factor how much the image should be made smaller, relative to the canvas. I use a power of two to
avoid that the canvas is a bit fuzzy.

=back

=cut

has 'image'   => (isa => 'Image::Magick', is => 'rw', required => 1);
has 'x'       => (isa => 'Int', is => 'rw');
has 'y'       => (isa => 'Int', is => 'rw');
has 'squeeze' => (isa => 'Num', is => 'rw');

=head2 Methods

=over

=item B<halfsize>

Makes the overlay smaller by 2. This will be called by the DZI algorithm.

=cut

sub halfsize {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($w, $h) = $self->image->GetAttributes ('width', 'height');                     # current dimensions
    $self->image->Resize (width => int($w/2), height => int($h/2));                    # half size
    $self->{x} /= 2;                                                                   # dont forget x, y 
    $self->{y} /= 2;
}

=item B<crop>

Gets a tile off the overlay.

=cut
